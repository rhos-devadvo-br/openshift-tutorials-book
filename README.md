## Leading Multicloud Container Development Platform

Red Hat OpenShift is named a leader across 29 criteria and 8 major vendors by the [https://www.openshift.com/2020-forrester-wave?hsLang=en-us](Q3 2020 Forrester Wave report).

## Red Hat OpenShift offerings and costs

Red Hat OpenShift clusters can be "managed" or "self-managed". Managed cluster's compute and network infrastructures are hosted and managed by cloud providers while self-managed clusters need to be installed from scratch - they can be installed on traditional cloud infrastructure nevertheless. A full list of supported cloud providers which have managed OpenShift offerings can be viewed here: https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing/.

OpenShift clusters have a Red Hat monthly license cost attached, while the compute and network infrastructure costs are paid to a specific cloud provider and vary depending on the allocated resources and specific provider's price plans.

## Creating a managed OpenShift cluster at IBM Cloud

There are two types of managed OpenShift clusters "as a Service" at IBM Cloud: a cluster created with classic infrastructure, or one created with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure. VPC clusters have a virtual network layer built on top of the Virtual Servers Instances (VSI's). This network layer provides isolation and improved customization capabilities for the subjacent compute infrastructure.
